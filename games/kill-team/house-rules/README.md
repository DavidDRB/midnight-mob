## Rules

### Q. If my model successfully charges my opponent's model, then later takes it out of action in the Fight phase of the same battle round, can my model consolidate into other nearby models and fight again?

A. Yes, but only if each of the following criteria are met:
- Your model or faction has an ability that allows models to fight again in the same Fight phase.
- The consolidation targets were also declared as charge targets during your most recent Movement phase.

#### Example
For example, take the case where Player 1 controls model A, and Player 2 controls models B and C.

##### Movement Phase
During Player 1's Movement phase, they declare that model A will charge models B and C. In this scenario, let us assume that models B and C each opt to overwatch, and each fails to hit. Let us also assume that Player 1's charge roll was sufficient to bring model A within 1" of model B, but not within 1" of model's B and C, nor within 1" of model C. At the end of Player 1's Movement phase, model A has successfully charged, and models A and B are in combat.

##### Fight Phase
During Player 1's Fight phase, model A takes model B out of action. Since model A is not in combat with any other models, it may consolidate. At consolidation time, Player 1 moves model A 3" towards model C, which brings the two models within 1" of each other. Since model A declared model C as a charge target during Player 1's most recent Movement Phase AND model A has an ability that lets them fight again in the same battle rough, model A is eligible to fight again.
