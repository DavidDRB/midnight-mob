# Subfactions - Adeptus Custodes

## Subfactions

### The Solar Watch

"Castellans of the Blessed Worlds"

Roll a D6 for each mortal wound suffered by any of your Adeptus Custodes models
during the Psychic Phase. On a roll of 5+, the wound is not lost.

### The Dread Host

"Instrument of the Emperor's Wrath"

When determining the charge distance for an Adeptus Custodes model in your kill
team, roll 2D6 + D3. Although this brings the maximum charge distance to 15",
each charge target cannot be more than 12" from the activated model.

### The Shadowkeepers

"Auric Shackles"

When an opponent's model attempts to fall back from an Adeptus Custodes model in
your kill team, roll a D6. On a 4+ the opponent's model remains in combat. The
opponent may not activate this model again as part of the current phase.
